        <p class="offset-1 col-10">Getting cryptocurrency can be a bit of a pain the first time but its cool after that I promise!</p>

    <div class="row">
        <p class="offset-1 col-10">There are two main options you can take. The first is cheaper but takes longer and consists of
            buying Ethereum on Coinbase and then transferring your Ethereum to another crypto exchange, such as
            Binance, where you can buy Stellar Lumens with Ethereum. This process is described here: <a href="https://www.lumenauts.com/tutorials/how-to-buy-lumens-with-us-dollars">Lumenauts</a>
            In this article, when they refer to GDAX they mean Coinbase, the name changed. If you buy with your credit
            card you can get Ethereum in a few minutes, but the fee is higher, if you use your bank account the fee is
            lower but you have to wait a few days.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <p class="offset-1 col-10"> The second option is faster but more expensive and consists of buying Stellar directly using
            StellarX marketplace. This is generally easier but their fee is 1% of transaction and 5$ minimum, so you
            have to buy a lot more (more than you should ever use with love-button) for it be cheaper. Also you have to
            wait a few days for your bank transfer, do that here: <a href="https://www.stellarx.com/signup">StellarX</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <h5 class="offset-1 col-10">However you go about getting your Stellar Lumens, I highly recommend creating two accounts in
            your wallet, one where you will store all your assets and then another with only a few dollars at a time
            for tipping. When you're out of tipping money, just move some more over from your main account.
